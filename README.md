# TM470TheApp Final University project for a full stack mobile web app employing AWS technologies.

This repository contains all the code produced for development of a full stack mobile web application created for use a taxi driver tool for monitoring public transport hubs. I is hoped this could be developed to assist taxi drivers by being alerted to public transport arrivals to indicate increase in demand for taxis. 

Technologies used were REACT, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and AWS serverless cloud technologies. Such as Identity IAM security services, API hosting and serverless lambda functions for the back end access to DynamoDB database.

with thanks to Cloud Path and by Jonathan Spruance for boilerplate code and excellent you tube tutorials.
